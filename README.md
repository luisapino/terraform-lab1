# Terraform AKS
## Luisa Fernanda Casta√±o Pino
## Plataformas 2

First everything was set up so that I could use my azure account.

with the ID it gave me I can somehow set my account and be able to use it, also I created a folder where I will leave everything from terraform

Then the main.tf was modified so that a resource group called "labs_plataformas_rg" could be created, and an aks called lfcp-aks1, a node group, identity, labels, etc.

It was necessary to make the subscription_id with the ID that I threw in the first capture, also after giving terraform init and it was successful, I gave terraform fmt, then terraform plan and added 2 with some sensitive outputs to connect to it.

I also changed context, looking for the rg then the aks lfcp-aks1, I verified that it was in the context that was to start creating

In that context I was able to use kubectl, and use it to get the context

and I changed the context so that I could create a pod there:

I create a pod called pod-lab1

I expose it to be able to access it from the Internet, and I use the ip address it gives me and I can indeed connect and see the nginx screen.

And now also from the azure portal to see what was created with the terraform, such as the resource groups and within this the aks.

More detailed information such as subscription id, rg, location etc:

Then aks details, inside this you can see more information such as the running status, the subscription ID, the node pool, etc.

Then, to use lens which is like a display mode to be able to use it in Windows, two steps were necessary, like WSL do not automatically expose ports to Windows , so kubectl proxy was used to expose port 8001 to the network so I could use the lens on my windows and see the ifnformation from the pods and the YAML helped define the Kubernetes Service that Lens needed to read.

And this is the visualization, like for example I can see my pod-lab1, and see its status like when it was running at that time, the creation date, the usage, etc.

The pod was also destroyed at the end and that's it.

And that's all, thanks for watching :)))
